            Hi! My name is Alisa Vu and I am currently a fouth year undergraduate student at <abbr>UCSD</abbr> (University
            of California, San Diego), and am expecting to graduate by Spring 2025. Over the course of my undergrad, I have
            taken a variety of classes revolving around biology, chemistry, computer science, data sciences, and UI/UXdesign.
            I have recently been driving more into design, as it sparks my creativity and problem-solving skills. 
            <aside>
                I am always eager to continue to find more opportunities that will allow me to explore and develop 
                my skills in any data analysis or design related fields! &#9786;
            </aside>
        </p>
        <p>
            Out of school, I enjoy trying new cafes, as I am a huge matcha and coffee enthusiast. I also like staying
            active by strength training and running &ndash; one of my goals by the end of the year is to complete a marathon.
            In addition, I like hanging out with my friends and going to concerts. I am always open to trying new activities!
        </p>
